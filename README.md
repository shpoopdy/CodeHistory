# Code History
This project taught me how to create an iOS phone app that incorporated the use of SwiftUI functionality using a MVVM architecture.

# Swift
A basic understanding of Swift was needed to create this app as it makes use of classes for one of the models and structs for all the other files.

# SwiftUI
In the code I make use of SwiftUI features such as:
* NavigationView
* NavigationLink
* Stacks (VStack, HStack, ZStack)

# Models
Two models were used in the creation of this app:
* Game model
* Question model

# Views
There are a total of seven views that are used to build this app:
* GameView
* QuestionView
* ScoreView
* WelcomeView
* ChoiceTextView
* BottomTextView
* GameColor

# View Models
A total of two view models were used in this app:
* GameViewModel
* ScoreViewModel
